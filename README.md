# Wikipedia Citation Scraper

This is still very much a work in progress. This will be used to create
a dataset of sentences and their references from Wikipedia articles. With
the hope of having practical applications in machine learning.

NOTE: The `environment.yml` was created on macOS, this will not work on
Linux. I plan to build an environment file for Linux when I've made more
progress.
